# Tuladha Jejeg OT

Tuladha Jejeg is javanese typeface designed by **R.S. Wihananto**. based on a javanese metal type punched by **T. Roorda**. Originally developed using Graphite (famously supported in MOZILLA), now converted to Opentype with AFDKO FEA for better device and software support.

This opentype version isn't exactly the same as the original, due to the limitations of AFDKO FEA syntax, some shaping isn't working and collision are handled differently.

The first step of converting Tuladha jejeg to Opentype is to make it work. another features like more complex shape handling and unwanted collissions will be refined in future updates.
